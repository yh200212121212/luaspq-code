# Contributing to Luaspq

Luaspq welcomes contribution from everyone. Here are the guidelines if you are thinking of helping us:

## Contributions

Contributions to Luaspq or its dependencies should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the main tree or given feedback for changes that would be required. All contributions should follow this format, even those from core contributors.

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from contributors on the same issue.

Head over to Luaspq Starters to find good tasks to start with. If you come across words or jargon that do not make sense, please check the glossary first. If there's no matching entry, please make a pull request to add one with the content TODO so we can correct that!

## Pull Request Checklist

Branch from the DailyBeta branch and, if needed, rebase to the current DailyBeta branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile).

[Optional]Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
